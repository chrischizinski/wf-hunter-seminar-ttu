## Modeling methods

.pull-left[
<br>
- Used a capture-recapture approach to model parameters using state duck stamp purchase histories
  - recruitment, retention, license purchase probability, and realized population growth rate
- Covariates:  state, generation, rurality code, hunting opportunity, Ducks Unlimited (DU) membership
  - Rurality and hunting location determined by zip code
  - DU membership matched to state license databases
- Used the Anvil cloud supercomputers running the RMark package

## Modeling takeaways

- Age matters:  older individuals were more likely to retained and purchase on a regular basis, younger individuals are more likely to be recruited

- Rurality had a statistical influence but  effect size was minimal

- Hunting opportunity a statistical influence but effect size was also minimal

- Variation in parameters among states

- Strong influence of conservation organization membership

## Experimental regulations::Two tier

- Nebraska and South Dakota implemented an experimental Two-tier system of harvest regulations
 - approved by the the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for the 2021/22 hunting season and extended through 4 hunting seasons

- Hunters select one of two different regulatory options when registering through the Harvest Information Program (HIP) for duck hunting 
  - Tier I have 6 duck limit with species and sex limits 
  - Tier II have a reduced bag limit of 3 ducks per day but no sex or species-specific restrictions

- Hunters remain in selected tier for the entire duck season 
- Checked by law enforcement on the hunter’s HIP identification card 

- The social and ecological effects are being evaluated
  - Parts collections for all Tier II
  - Several surveys

### Objectives
1. Maintain or increase conservation support by increasing waterfowl hunting participation
2. Help assure the continuation of waterfowl hunting heritage
3. Maintain sustainable populations of all ducks
4. Increase funding for waterfowl management and conservation
5. Minimize monitoring and administrative costs of implementing, maintaining, and monitoring such a system]

## Two-tier::first-year takeaways
---
## Final points

- Individuals that participate in wildlife-based recreation do so for similar reasons

- No one "strong" reason why people are constrained in recreating
  - Likely the combination of a bunch of small things
  
- Waterfowl management is unique in the social-ecological approach to addressing this problem
  - "Experiments" may lead to new insights

- Addressing funding for conservation is an increasing worry.
  - Continued work will be required to address funding wildlife management and conservation
  - R3 will likely be only part of the solution
